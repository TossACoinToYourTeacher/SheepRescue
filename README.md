# SheepRescue
This is the delivery of the second lab of I.S.: Sheep Rescue game.

I managed to go through the whole instructions solving the issues that appeared here and there, furthermore, I managed to fulfill all the requests yet I 
  did not manage to implement any further improvement of this game; besides, there is some sort of bug I tried to fix for hours and hours and did not manage
  where the sheeps score twice and do twice the "Drop()" code function when they fall over the edge of the map.

Besides, I made a small mistake regarding the windmill wheel rotation at the beginning of the game.
  
This being said, you can start the game and click on the hay machine to change to your favorite color! There is Blue, Yellow and Red, once you have selected it
  just click start and the game will save your preferences and change the scene to play, you can also click quit and close the application.

Once in the game, the main objective is to save as many sheeps from falling over the edge as possible, you have to use your Hay Machine to throw them hay packs
  so that they can go back and be saved from falling, on top of the screen there is a score meaning how many sheeps you saved and a "cross" score indicating how
  many you did not manage to save; at all moments you can press Escape key on the keyboard to go back to the main menu, this menu will also pop on when you lose.

Related to the gameplay features, you can move the Hay Machine from right to left on the tracks, you can not move further than the limits at the end on the tracks.
You shoot hay packs by pressing Spacebar key on the keyboard, you can move the Hay Machine using "<-" or "a" to go left and "->" or "d" to move left and right 
  respectively.
 
Every time a Hay Pack reaches the end of the map or hit a Sheep they are removed as they serve no further purpose; this behavior also occurs with sheeps once they
  have hit a Hay Pack or fallen through the map; every time one of these actions happens a sound will occur to notify the player.

The "Escape Menu" or "Game Over Menu" has to be interacted with the mouse.
